Version: 0.2.0
Date: 07. 11. 2023
  Major Features:
    - This version should not break any savegames. It may however break some of the supply chains or power supply that you've set up. Read more below.
    - BREAKING: Wind turbines have been removed. Their intent was an easy kick-starting of remote primary industries, which can be done better with 
      solar panels now. Please replace them with solar panels if necessary.
    - BREAKING: The town hall's inventory and its items have been removed. There was no mod-related purpose for it since dropping the story, and 
      there were issues with third party mod inserters.
    - BREAKING: The city's range to access supply buildings has been decreased from previosul 1,000 tiles to now 150 tiles. 150 is still a pretty large area, and
      shouldn't cause issues for most savegames. You can see the range as a green overlay when you are about to place a supply building such as a market. If you built
      supply buildings outside of the updated city's range, you have to relocate them closer to the town hall.
    - BREAKING: Cities from savegames started before 0.2 will build houses not properly aligned in their cells. This shouldn't break anything, 
      but I wanted to give you a heads up. This is not going to be fixed for older savegames.
    - You can now fund new cities by researching the multiple cities technology, building an urban planning center, and providing it with enough currency. 
      To spawn a new city, there must be enough explored, unobstructed area on the map. You can learn more about that in the tips and tricks which will show up 
      when you research multiple cities. Currently you can have up to 6 cities.
    - You can use the multiple cities overview to keep an eye on the cities' supply even if you're working somewhere else. 
      Use the default hotkey CTRL + T or the shortcut (which you can select near the deconstruction tool) to open the overview.
    - Once you have multiple cities with residential or highrise housing, cities will spawn passengers in train stations. Research the technology public transportation
      to build train stations. You don't necessarily need to transport passengers with trains, but it's a good fit for a public transportation network. You can learn 
      more about that in the tips and tricks which will show up when you public transportation.
  Features:
    - When you place a supply building, you will now see a green overlay that shows you the city's range (150 tiles). Supply buildings or train stations need to be in this
      range for the city to access it.
    - Instead of just calling it City 1, there are now Factorio-themed city names. You're welcome to contribute more!
  Changes:
    - The recipe to milk cows has been extracted from husbandry into its own technology. It made a bit more sense to me to have that researchable closer to when you need to bottle milk.
      Savegames from before 0.2 which already had bottling researched, have this new tech researched by default.
    - When a new city spawns (including the initial one) you can now see a location marker on the map, and the location is also visible in the chat. Click on the location to see the town hall on the map.
  Balancing:
    - Updated the amount of science needed for Tycoon technologies.
  Bugfixes:
    - Added missing icon for the town hall.
    - The town hall now shows basic needs as "Supplied" when there are no citizens that require anything yet.
    - Previously the mod sometimes only interacted with the first player, which may have caused issues in multiplayer games. This has been fixed, but I'm not sure how
      well this mod works with multiplayer yet.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.6

    - Rail crossings: Streets can now build across orthogonal rails.

    - Added a new inventory/recipe tab for tycoon recipes, and properly ordered tycoon items.
  Features:
    - Gardens now spawn in gaps where any other buildings/roads are unlikely to spawn.
  Changes:
    - When producing milk, the cow now has a 2% chance to die (98% success rate). On average each should yield 5,000 milk and last 50 minutes.
    - When a house or road couldn't be built earlier due to blocking entities, it will now reattempt construction there after a while.
    - The town hall GUI now mentions that urbanization is required for growth.
  Bugfixes:
    - Instead of crashing the game on invalid grid access, the mod now logs an error and tries to let the game continue.
    - Fixed placement and scaling of houses.
    - Prevent city from expanding into uncharted territory (and breaking subsequently).
    - Fixed an issue where roads would continue to build straight indefinitely.
    - Fixed an issue where houses would build far away from roads.
    - Fixed an issue where destroying/mining houses would not update the citizen count.

    - Rebalancing of all Tycoon supply chains.
    - New primary industries: Fishery (spawns next to bodies of water)
    - New items: Milk (liquid), Bottle, Used Bottle, Flour, Dough, Bread, Fish Filet
    - New technologies that unlock supply chains: Farming, Husbandry, Meat Processing, Bottling, and Baking
    - New technologies that unlock housing tiers: Residential Housing, and Highrise Housing
    - Improve the town hall GUI with much more information
  Changes:
    - Increased currency value to reduce the amount of inserters needed: Each currency item is now worth 20x as much as it was before, but you get fewer of them.
    - Housing tiers (residential, highrise) now have to be researched and don't unlock automatically.
    - Rebalanced university production to be slightly more expensive than vanilla science packs.
    - Rebalanced the currency you get per resource that citizens consume. They now reflect the amount of energy required to produce them.
    - Use a predictable randomizer based on the map seed. If you run a map with the same seed, the cities should be equal across savegames. Each city will still be random.
    - Roads will now extend through power poles, lamps, and ground pipes (not above ground pipes).
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix typos in the English localization.
    - Fixed an issue where primary industries could spawn with their pipe connections right next to water or cliffs, which made them unusable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.17
Date: 06. 10. 2023
  Major Features:
    - BREAKING CHANGE: Savegames from 0.0.16 and previous versions probably won't work anymore
    - New road algorithm: Roads that expand instead of random placements (e.g. no more unonnected circles)
    - Construction sites: When the city starts a new building, it first places a construction site. After some time the construction site turns into a building. The same applies to house upgrades.
    - Two new house types: As your city grows, simple houses (previously residential) will be upgraded to residential and later to highrise buildings, once  your city grows large enough.
      Simple houses cost 1 stone and 1 iron plate. They can house 4 citizens.
      Residential houses cost 20 stone and 10 iron plates. They can house 20 citizens.
      Highrise houses cost 100 stone, and 50 iron plates, and 25 steel plates. They can house 100 citizens.
  Changes:
    - Temporarily, the cost to build roads has been dropped.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.16
Date: 02. 10. 2023

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.15
Date: 30. 09. 2023
  Major Features:
    - BREAKING CHANGE: The change to consume resources from all available markets/stores also impacted the story's steps.

  Features:
    - Extended the story to guide you through the milk and meat supply chains.
  Changes:
    - When adding a tag on the map for primary productions, the tag now includes the industry's English name for better visibility.
    - Reduce citizen thresholds for new supply chains from 250 to 100, and from 500 to 200. On savegames from previous versions you may still need to get to the previous thresholds.
    - Simplified the town hall's gui. Basic needs are now really calculated every time you reopen the view.
    - In the town hall's gui the text "Basic needs met: yes/no" has been removed. The coloring of items in the basic needs section should be enough.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed an issue where the story might not progress if you have multiple Tycoon buildings of them same type and only supply one.
