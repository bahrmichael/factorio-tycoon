Date: 15. 10. 2023
  Features:
    - Gardens now spawn where in gaps where any other buildings/roads are unlikely to spawn.
  Changes:
    - When producing milk, the cow now has a 2% chance to die (98% success rate). On average each could should yield 5,000 milk and last 50 minutes.
    - Rail crossings: Streets can now build across orthogonal rails.
    - When a house or road couldn't be built earlier due to blocking entities, it will now reattempt construction there after a while.
  Bugfixes:
    - Instead of crashing the game on invalid grid access, the mod now logs an error and tries to let the game continue.
    - Fixed placement and scaling of houses.
    - Prevent city from expanding into uncharted territory (and breaking subsequently).
    - Fixed an issue where roads would continue to build straight indefinitely.

Date: 11. 10. 2023

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.21
Date: 11. 10. 2023
  Balancing:
    - 10x the apple farm production (and energy consumption).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.20
Date: 11. 10. 2023
  Major Features:
    - BREAKING CHANGE! So much changed! tl;dr: Story has been replaced with technologies.
    - Rebalancing of all Tycoon supply chains.
    - New primary industries: Fishery (spawns next to bodies of water)
    - New items: Milk (liquid), Bottle, Used Bottle, Flour, Dough, Bread, Fish Filet
    - New technologies that unlock supply chains: Farming, Husbandry, Meat Processing, Bottling, and Baking
    - New technologies that unlock housing tiers: Residential Housing, and Highrise Housing
    - Improve the town hall GUI with much more information
  Changes:
    - Increased currency value to reduce the amount of inserters needed: Each currency item is now worth 20x as much as it was before, but you get fewer of them.
    - Housing tiers (residential, highrise) now have to be researched and don't unlock automatically.
    - Rebalanced university production to be slightly more expensive than vanilla science packs.
    - Rebalanced the currency you get per resource that citizens consume. They now reflect the amount of energy required to produce them.
    - Use a predictable randomizer based on the map seed. If you run a map with the same seed, the cities should be equal across savegames. Each city will still be random.
    - Roads will now extend through power poles, lamps, and ground pipes (not above ground pipes).
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix typos in the English localization.
    - Fixed an issue where primary industries could spawn with their pipe connections right next to water or cliffs, which made them unusable.

Version: 0.0.19
Date: 07. 10. 2023
  Bugfixes:

Version: 0.0.17
Date: 06. 10. 2023
  Major Features:
    - BREAKING CHANGE: Savegames from 0.0.16 and previous versions probably won't work anymore
    - New road algorithm: Roads that expand instead of random placements (e.g. no more unonnected circles)
    - Construction sites: When the city starts a new building, it first places a construction site. After some time the construction site turns into a building. The same applies to house upgrades.
    - Two new house types: As your city grows, simple houses (previously residential) will be upgraded to residential and later to highrise buildings, once  your city grows large enough.
      Simple houses cost 1 stone and 1 iron plate. They can house 4 citizens.
      Residential houses cost 20 stone and 10 iron plates. They can house 20 citizens.
      Highrise houses cost 100 stone, and 50 iron plates, and 25 steel plates. They can house 100 citizens.
  Changes:
    - Temporarily, the cost to build roads has been dropped.

Version: 0.0.16
Date: 02. 10. 2023

Version: 0.0.15
Date: 30. 09. 2023
  Major Features:

  Changes:
    - When adding a tag on the map for primary productions, the tag now includes the industry's English name for better visibility.
    - Reduce citizen thresholds for new supply chains from 250 to 100, and from 500 to 200. On savegames from previous versions you may still need to get to the previous thresholds.
    - Simplified the town hall's gui. Basic needs are now really calculated every time you reopen the view.
    - In the town hall's gui the text "Basic needs met: yes/no" has been removed. The coloring of items in the basic needs section should be enough.
