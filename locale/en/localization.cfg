think-story-1=Everyone okay? We crash-landed, and are now stranded here.
think-story-2=What do you mean stranded? Can't we just fix the ship and head back?
think-story-3=I wish it were that simple. But the damage is extensive. We should set up a base here.
think-story-4=We managed to recover some resources and built a town hall nearby. We stored what's still intact in there.
think-story-5=Hey Engineer! Our water supplies are running low. To supply our city with water, we need a water tower. Please craft one!
think-story-6=Good! Now place it near the town hall, and connect it to a water source. We should have pipes and stuff in the town hall.
think-story-7=So refreshing! We're not thirsty anymore. But I'm getting a bit hungry.
think-story-8=Bad news: We're running low on food. There is an apple farm in the south. Let's help it grow some apples!
think-story-9=The first apples have grown and can be collected! Let's bring them to the market before the citizens become hungry.
think-story-10=Oh, I forgot about the market! Can you set one up and send the apples there?
think-story-11=Those apples are tasty! Yum! Now we're ready to build some houses!
think-story-12=Hey Engineer! Let's set the city up for expansion. The first step is to build a hardware store in our city. You can now craft it.
think-story-13=Perfect! We need to supply iron plates and stone in the hardware store. There should be some nice rocks and ore patches around here.
think-story-14=Great job! We'll get right to work. Let's see how much we can build with the new resources.
think-story-15=We just built a treasury where taxes are collected. Each time citizens buy food or water, some taxes are stored in the treasury.
think-story-16=We can use the money to fund research. Let's start by building a university and placing it near the city.
think-story-17=Great! Now that we have a university, you can supply it with currency and fund some reasearch.
think-story-18=We can further grow the city to fund even more research. The possibilities are endless!
think-story-19=Let's keep the city growing until we reach 100 citizens. Make sure you meet the basic needs of the city as it grows. Check out the town hall to get more details.
think-story-20=Amazing! Our city is thriving with 100 citizens. However, people are starting to ask for something more than just water and food. We've heard a lot of talk about needing milk bottles lately. Could you look into it?
think-story-21=You've done it, Engineer! Our morning cereals are so much better now. The children are happy, and even the adults can't stop smiling. Thank you for bringing the simple joy of milk back into our lives! Will we reach 200 citizens soon?
think-story-22=200 people strong and growing! Our citizens are asking for a bit more variety in their meals, specifically meat. Could you find a way to get that on the menu?
think-story-23=Engineer, you've outdone yourself! The aroma of barbecue is filling the air and it's all thanks to you. Tonight, we feast in your honor. This is more than just food; it's a boost to our community spirit!
