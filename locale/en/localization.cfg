tycoon-about-tycoon=Tycoon is a mod all about becoming a transportation tycoon. You can help cities grow, and the next feature release will allow you to fund new cities, and transport passengers. All of those actions will give you [item=tycoon-currency] which you can use for various things such as funding research.\n\nThis mod is not a full overhaul, but adds new gameplay mechanics that you can use alongside overhauls like Space Exploration or Krastorio 2. Of course you can also just play Tycoon on its own and enjoy the cities' growth and public transporation networks.\n\n[font=default-bold]Community and Support[/font]\n\nIf you'd like to interact with the community that plays the Tycoon mod, check out the mod's description on the Factorio mod portal website: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/tycoon \nThere you can find links to the Discord, the developer's Twitch, and ways to financially support the development. Feedback and suggestions are more than welcome!\n\n[font=default-bold]Credits[/font]\n\nTranslators:\n\n  - [font=default-bold]Brasilian[/font]: luis das artimanhas
tycoon-cities=Cities are the heart of the Tycoon mod. Starting with a town hall at their center, they can grow outwards and develop new demands.\n\n[font=default-bold]Town Hall[/font]\n\nThe [entity=tycoon-town-hall] is the center of your city. When you click on it, you can see details about your city, such as its basic needs and how well it is supplied.\n\n[font=default-bold]City Growth[/font]\n\nTo help cities grow, you need to provide items for their basic needs and construction through supply buildings.\nYou can use the [entity=tycoon-water-tower] to provide water, the [entity=tycoon-market] for food, and the [entity=tycoon-hardware-store] for construction material.\n\nWater is free, but food and construction materials yield some [item=tycoon-currency]. Once your city has built a [entity=tycoon-treasury] you can find the currency that citizens pay there.

Once a city has built a [entity=tycoon-treasury] you can find the currency there.\n\nYou can use currency to fund research through the [entity=tycoon-university].

You can build one or more of each type, and the city will consume from all of them.\n\n[font=default-bold]Range (soon)[/font]\n\nSupply buildings have to be built within the city's range. You can see the valid range with a green overlay when you place a supply building.\n\n[font=default-bold]Markets[/font]\n\nWith the [entity=tycoon-market] you can provide basic needs such as [item=tycoon-apple].

Simply build an offshore pump nearby, and connect it with pipes to the water tower.
tycoon-primary-industries=Tycoon introduces new primary industries, such as [entity=tycoon-apple-farm] and [entity=tycoon-wheat-farm]. They can be found all across the map.\n\nIf the supply of existing primary industries is not sufficient, consider exploring more of the map, or increase their productivity with technologies such as [technology=tycoon-apple-farm-productivity-1].
tycoon-residential-needs=Your cities are now able to upgrade simple houses to residential houses, but it needs new resources to upgrade and feed the population.\n\nEach residential house can support 20 citizens.\n\n[font=default-bold]Basic Needs[/font]\n\nThe residential citizens additionally consume [item=tycoon-meat] and [item=tycoon-bread]. They must be available in sufficient quantities in one or more [entity=tycoon-market].\nYou need to research [technology=tycoon-baking] and [technology=tycoon-meat-processing] to produce those.\n\n[font=default-bold]Construction Materials[/font]\n\nUpgrading a simple house to a residential house requires 10 [item=steel-plate], 20 [item=iron-plate], 30 [item=stone-brick], and 2 [item=small-lamp].
tycoon-highrise-needs=Your cities are now able to upgrade residential houses to highrise houses, but it needs new resources to upgrade and feed the population.\n\nEach highrise house can support 100 citizens,\n\n[font=default-bold]Basic Needs[/font]\n\nThe residential citizens additionally consume [item=tycoon-fish-filet] and [item=tycoon-milk-bottle]. They must be available in sufficient quantities in one or more [entity=tycoon-market].\nYou need to research [technology=tycoon-bottling] and [technology=tycoon-meat-processing] to produce those.\n\n[font=default-bold]Construction Materials[/font]\n\nUpgrading a simple house to a residential house requires 50 [item=concrete], 25 [item=steel-plate], 10 [item=pipe], 2 [item=pipe], and 5 [item=small-lamp].
tycoon-fund-new-cities=Congratulations! You achieved a major milestone and can now fund new cities.\n\nTo fund a new city, you need to build a [entity=tycoon-urban-planning-center], provide it with [item=tycoon-currency] and explore enough of the map so that there's space for a new city. They don't like to spawn close to each other.\n\nThe cost of new cities increases quadratically. The first one costs 1,000 [item=tycoon-currency], the second costs 2,000, the third costs 4,000 and so on.\n\nAll [entity=tycoon-urban-planning-center] work together. That means you can store [item=tycoon-currency] in each of them, and the total sum will be considered.
