think-story-1=Everyone okay? We crash-landed, and are now stranded here.
think-story-2=What do you mean stranded? Can't we just fix the ship and head back?
think-story-3=I wish it were that simple. But the damage is extensive. We should set up a base here.
think-story-4=We managed to recover some resources and built a town hall nearby. We stored what's still intact in there.
think-story-5=Hey Engineer! Our water supplies are running low. To supply our city with water, we need a water tower. Please craft one!
think-story-6=Good! Now place it near the town hall, and connect it to a water source. We should have pipes and stuff in the town hall.
think-story-7=So refreshing! We're not thirsty anymore. But I'm getting a bit hungry.
think-story-8=Bad news: We're running low on food. There is an apple farm in the south. Let's help it grow some apples!
think-story-9=The first apples have grown and can be collected! Let's bring them to the market before the citizens become hungry.
think-story-10=Oh, I forgot about the market! Can you set one up and send the apples there?
think-story-11=Those apples are tasty! Yum! Now we're ready to build some houses!
think-story-12=Hey Engineer! Let's set the city up for expansion. The first step is to build a hardware store in our city. You can now craft it.
think-story-13=Perfect! We need to supply iron plates and stone in the hardware store. There should be some nice rocks and ore patches around here.
think-story-14=Great job! We'll get right to work. Let's see how much we can build with the new resources.
think-story-15=We just built a treasury where taxes are collected. Each time citizens buy food or water, some taxes are stored in the treasury.
think-story-16=We can use the money to fund research. Let's start by building a university and placing it near the city.
think-story-17=Great! Now that we have a university, you can supply it with currency and fund some reasearch.
think-story-18=We can further grow the city to fund even more research. The possibilities are endless!
