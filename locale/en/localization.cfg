[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
tycoon-about-tycoon=Tycoon is a mod all about becoming a transportation tycoon. You can help cities grow, and the next feature release will allow you to fund new cities, and transport passengers. All of those actions will give you [item=tycoon-currency] which you can use for various things such as funding research.\n\nThis mod is not a full overhaul, but adds new gameplay mechanics that you can use alongside overhauls like Space Exploration or Krastorio 2. Of course you can also just play Tycoon on its own and enjoy the cities' growth and public transporation networks.\n\n[font=default-bold]Community and Support[/font]\n\nIf you'd like to interact with the community that plays the Tycoon mod, check out the mod's description on the Factorio mod portal website: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/tycoon \nThere you can find links to the Discord, the developer's Twitch, and ways to financially support the development. Feedback and suggestions are more than welcome!\n\n[font=default-bold]Credits[/font]\n\nTranslators:\n\n  - [font=default-bold]Brasilian[/font]: luis das artimanhas\n  - [font=default-bold]Japanese[/font]: yuyuyuxyu
tycoon-cities=Cities are the heart of the Tycoon mod. Starting with a town hall at their center, they can grow outwards and develop new demands.\n\n[font=default-bold]Town Hall[/font]\n\nThe [entity=tycoon-town-hall] is the center of your city. When you click on it, you can see details about your city, such as its basic needs and how well it is supplied.\n\n[font=default-bold]City Growth[/font]\n\nTo help cities grow, you need to provide items for their basic needs and construction through supply buildings.\nYou can use the [entity=tycoon-water-tower] to provide water, the [entity=tycoon-market] for food, and the [entity=tycoon-hardware-store] for construction material.\n\nWater is free, but food and construction materials yield some [item=tycoon-currency]. Once your city has built a [entity=tycoon-treasury] you can find the currency that citizens pay there. It will be one of the first buildings that your city builds.\n\n[font=default-bold]Better Housing[/font]\n\nAs your city expands, it will be able to build more advanced buildings as you unlock higher housing tiers such as [technology=tycoon-residential-housing] or [technology=tycoon-highrise-housing]. They come with vastly more space for citizens, but come with new basic needs and construction material requirements.
tycoon-currency=[item=tycoon-currency] is your reward for supplying a city with food and construction materials. Once a city has built a [entity=tycoon-treasury] you can find the currency there.\n\nYou can use currency to fund research through the [entity=tycoon-university]. This is an easy way to get some more advanced science packs, but is more expensive than producing science pack with the traditional Factorio approach.
tycoon-supply-buildings=Cities consume resources that you can provide through supply buildings. You can build one or more of each type, and the city will consume from all of them.\n\n[font=default-bold]Range (soon)[/font]\n\nSupply buildings have to be built within the city's range. You can see the valid range with a green overlay when you place a supply building.\n\n[font=default-bold]Markets[/font]\n\nWith the [entity=tycoon-market] you can provide basic needs such as [item=tycoon-apple]. You can grow those in [entity=tycoon-apple-farm]. Have a look at the map to find farms.\n\n[font=default-bold]Hardware Stores[/font]\n\nWith the [entity=tycoon-hardware-store] you can provide construction materials such as [item=stone-brick] or [item=iron-plate].\n\n[font=default-bold]Water Towers[/font]\n\nWith the [entity=tycoon-water-tower] you can provide water to the citizens. Simply build an offshore pump nearby, and connect it with pipes to the water tower.
tycoon-primary-industries=Tycoon introduces new primary industries, such as [entity=tycoon-apple-farm] and [entity=tycoon-wheat-farm]. They can be found all across the map.\n\nIf the supply of existing primary industries is not sufficient, consider exploring more of the map, or increase their productivity with technologies such as [technology=tycoon-apple-farm-productivity-1].
tycoon-residential-needs=Your cities are now able to upgrade simple houses to residential houses, but they need new resources to upgrade and feed the population.\n\nEach residential house supports 20 citizens.\n\n[font=default-bold]Basic Needs[/font]\n\nThe residential citizens consume [item=tycoon-meat], [item=tycoon-bread], [item=tycoon-milk-bottle], and [item=tycoon-fish-filet]. Keep the cities well supplied to achieve maximum growth speed.\n\n[font=default-bold]Construction Materials[/font]\n\nUpgrading a simple house to a residential house requires 10 [item=steel-plate], 20 [item=iron-plate], 30 [item=stone-brick], and 2 [item=small-lamp].
tycoon-highrise-needs=Your cities are now able to upgrade residential houses to highrise houses, but they need new resources to upgrade and feed the population.\n\nEach highrise house can support 100 citizens,\n\n[font=default-bold]Basic Needs[/font]\n\nThe residential citizens consume [item=tycoon-smoothie], [item=tycoon-apple-cake], [item=tycoon-cheese], , [item=tycoon-burger], and [item=tycoon-dumpling]. Keep the cities well supplied to achieve maximum growth speed.\n\n[font=default-bold]Construction Materials[/font]\n\nUpgrading a simple house to a residential house requires 50 [item=concrete], 25 [item=steel-plate], 10 [item=pipe], 2 [item=pump], and 5 [item=small-lamp].
tycoon-fund-new-cities=Congratulations! You achieved a major milestone and can now [font=default-bold]fund new cities[/font].\n\nTo fund a new city, you need to build a [entity=tycoon-urban-planning-center], provide it with [item=tycoon-currency] and explore enough of the map so that there's space for a new city. They don't like to spawn close to each other.\n\nThe cost of new cities increases quadratically. The first additional city costs 1,000 [item=tycoon-currency], the second costs 4,000, the third costs 8,000 and so on.\n\nAll [entity=tycoon-urban-planning-center] work together. That means you can store [item=tycoon-currency] in each of them, and the total sum will be considered.
tycoon-cities-overview=Keeping an eye on all your cities can be tricky when they're far apart. Luckily you can now access the cities overview.\n\nYou can open the overview through the [img=tycoon-cities-overview-shortcut] shortcut (next to e.g. the deconstruction tool) or with the hotkey __CONTROL__tycoon-cities-overview__.\n\nThe info on each city's tab is the same as the one you see when opening a [entity=tycoon-town-hall].
tycoon-public-transportation=Congratulations! You achieved a major milestone and can now [font=default-bold]transport passengers[/font]. Each passenger has an origin, a time they started, and a destination.\n\nEach city that has residential or highrise citizens, will produce passengers in each [entity=tycoon-passenger-train-station] that you place within their range. The more residential and highrise citizens you have, the more passengers for other cities will appear.\n\nPassengers don't care how you bring them to their destination, but they care about getting there quickly.\n\n[font=default-bold]Rewards[/font]\n\nPassengers will pay you when you bring them to a [entity=tycoon-passenger-train-station] in their destination city. The rewarded [item=tycoon-currency] depends on the distance between cities and the time travelled. The longer the distance, the higher the reward. The [item=tycoon-currency] will be places into the destinatino city's [entity=tycoon-treasury].
tycoon-passenger-train-stations=When you build a [entity=tycoon-passenger-train-station] within a city's range, you tell their citizens that you'll help them travel to other cities.\n\nYou can build any number of train stations per city, as long as they are in the city's range. New passengers will appear in a random train station of that city if there is more than one.\n\n[font=default-bold]Limit Departing Passengers[/font]\n\nTrain stations don't have unlimited space, and as more and more passengers want to depart, it may fill up. By default the train stations will only allow up to 80 departing passengers so that there's a bit of space for arrivals. You can configure this per train station when opening its GUI.\n\n[font=default-bold]Filter Destination[/font]\n\nAs you fund more cities through the [entity=tycoon-urban-planning-center], you need to build a network between all current and future cities. Passengers for new cities will automatically show up in your train stations, unless filtered out any destinations.\n\nYou can filter out destinations by opening a train station's GUI and checking off city names. If you checked off any city name in a train station, then future cities will not automatically produce new passengers in this train station.\n\n[font=default-bold]Arrivals[/font]\n\nThe train station also acts as the place where passengers can arrive. Just place the arriving passenger in the train station, and they will automatically be removed.
